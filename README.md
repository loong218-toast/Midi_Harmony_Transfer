# Algorithm

The algorithm compares two distributions of two different Midi files, then one will adjusts its notes distribution to fit another one. <br/>
The distribution fitting process is done by moving groups of notes which are majority, and move to those notes that are minority.
The algorithm also creates relationships between musical notes by grouping them, and those notes are moved together.
